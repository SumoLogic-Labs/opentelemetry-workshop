# Custom Distributions exercise

* Read the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/distributions/#custom-distributions)

* Take a look at the [official vendors list](https://opentelemetry.io/vendors/)

* Compare two different distributions, eg. [AWS Otel Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) and [Sumo Logic Otel Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) - what different compoents they include?

* Compare those two versus [otelcol contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/blob/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib/manifest.yaml)

* Take a quick look at the [OpenTelemetry Collector builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder) documentation - maybe, at some point, you'd like to build your own distribution?
