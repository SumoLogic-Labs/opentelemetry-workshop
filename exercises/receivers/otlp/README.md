# OTLP Receiver exercise

OTLP protocol is one of the most important parts of the OpenTelemetry project. While here we show how to use it for traces, it can be used for logs and metrics as well.

* Run the otelcol instance using the prepared [config](config.yaml) file.

  ```bash
  otelcol-contrib --config config.yaml
  ```

  You should see the following otelcol log lines:

  ```text
  2022-05-27T21:05:55.399+0200	info	otlpreceiver/otlp.go:88	Starting HTTP server on endpoint 0.0.0.0:4318	{"kind": "receiver", "name": "otlp"}
  2022-05-27T21:05:55.400+0200	info	builder/receivers_builder.go:73	Receiver started.	{"kind": "receiver", "name": "otlp"}
  ```

  At this point otelcol is litening on `0.0.0.0:4318` address waiting for incoming spans - building blocks for traces

* Spans can be created using the OpenTelemetry libraries available for many programming languages. They can be sent over HTTP as simple JSON as well. Here we will send them with simple `curl` command.

  Take a look at the [send-span.sh](./send-span.sh) script. Make sure it will send span to your locally running otelcol instance:

  ```bash
  $ ./send-span.sh
  *   Trying 127.0.0.1:4318...
  * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 4318 (#0)
  > POST /v1/traces HTTP/1.1
  > Host: localhost:4318
  > User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
  > Accept: */*
  > Content-type: application/json
  > Content-Length: 877
  >
  * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  < Content-Type: application/json
  < Date: Fri, 27 May 2022 19:15:12 GMT
  < Content-Length: 2
  <
  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
  {}
  ```

* In the `otelcol` logs output you should see the same span received:

  ```text

  ```

* Play a bit with the [send-span.sh](./send-span.sh) script, for example:
  * add the `spans.motto` key with `"there is no trace"` value to resource attributes (labels)
  * add the `use.otlp.for` key with `"all three: logs, metrics and traces"` value to the record attributes
